      "**Explanation**\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We create an empty dictionary `num_dict` to store numbers we've seen so far and their indices.\n",
      "2. We iterate through the list of numbers using `enumerate`, which gives us both the index `i` and the current number `num`.\n",
      "3. For each number, we calculate its complement by subtracting it from the target sum.\n",
      "4. We check if the complement is already in the dictionary. If it is, it means we've found two numbers that add up to the target sum, so we return them.\n",
      "5. If not, we add the current number to the dictionary with its index as the value.\n",
      "6. If we've iterated through the entire list and haven't found a solution, we return `None`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Time Complexity**\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "* The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list of numbers. This is because we're doing a single pass through the list.\n",
      "* The space complexity is also O(n), as we're storing at most n numbers in the dictionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note**\n",
      "--------\n",
      "\n",
      "* This implementation assumes that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n",
      "* You can return the answer in any order.\n",

      "\n",
      "REFLECTION\n",
      "\n",
      " **Critique and Recommendations**\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided implementation of the Two Sum problem in Python is well-structured, readable, and efficient. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Error Handling**: The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or the target sum is not a number. It would be good to add some error handling code to handle these scenarios.\n",
      "2. **Input Validation**: The function assumes that the input list contains only numbers. It would be good to add some input validation to ensure that the list only contains numbers.\n",
      "3. **Type Hints**: The function parameters and return types can be annotated with type hints to make the code more readable and self-documenting.\n",
      "4. **Docstring**: The docstring is well-written, but it can be improved by adding more details about the function's behavior, such as what happens when the input list is empty or the target sum is not found.\n",
      "5. **Example Usage**: The example usage is good, but it can be improved by adding more test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior in different scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Updated Implementation**\n",

       "\n",
       "1. We create an empty dictionary `num_dict` to store numbers we've seen so far and their indices.\n",
       "2. We iterate through the list of numbers using `enumerate`, which gives us both the index `i` and the current number `num`.\n",
       "3. For each number, we calculate its complement by subtracting it from the target sum.\n",
       "4. We check if the complement is already in the dictionary. If it is, it means we've found two numbers that add up to the target sum, so we return them.\n",
       "5. If not, we add the current number to the dictionary with its index as the value.\n",
       "6. If we've iterated through the entire list and haven't found a solution, we return `None`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Time Complexity**\n",
       "------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "* The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list of numbers. This is because we're doing a single pass through the list.\n",
       "* The space complexity is also O(n), as we're storing at most n numbers in the dictionary.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Note**\n",
       "--------\n",
       "\n",
       "* This implementation assumes that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n",
       "* You can return the answer in any order."
