      "REFLECTION\n",

      " **Critique and Recommendations**\n",
      "-------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided code is a clean and efficient solution to the Two Sum problem. However, here are some minor suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Type Hints**: The function `two_sum` is missing type hints for the return value. It should be `-> Optional[List[int]]` to indicate that it returns a list of two integers or `None` if no solution is found.\n",
      "2. **Error Handling**: The function does not check if the input list `nums` is empty or if the target sum `target` is not an integer. Adding some error handling code would make the function more robust.\n",
      "3. **Docstring**: The docstring for the function `two_sum` is well-written, but it could be improved by adding more details about the return value and the expected input.\n",
      "4. **Variable Names**: The variable name `num_dict` is clear, but it could be renamed to something more descriptive like `num_to_index` to indicate its purpose.\n",
      "5. **Example Usage**: The example usage code could be moved to a separate function or class to make the code more modular and reusable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Practices\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Follow PEP 8**: The code mostly follows PEP 8, but there are a few minor issues, such as missing blank lines between functions and classes.\n",
      "2. **Use a linter**: Running a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` can help catch minor issues and improve the overall quality of the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code Refactoring\n",
      "\n",

       "\n",
       "1. Create a dictionary `num_dict` to store the numbers we have seen so far and their indices.\n",
       "2. Iterate through the `nums` array.\n",
       "3. For each number, calculate its complement (the number that would add up to the target sum).\n",
       "4. Check if the complement is in the `num_dict`. If it is, return the indices of the complement and the current number.\n",
       "5. If the complement is not in the `num_dict`, add the current number and its index to the `num_dict`.\n",
       "6. If we reach the end of the array without finding a solution, return `None`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Time Complexity**\n",
       "------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array, because we make a single pass through the array.\n",

       "**Space Complexity**\n",
       "-------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst-case scenario, we may need to store all the numbers in the `num_dict`."
